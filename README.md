# AutoencoderTexturesByRE

The .ipynb file conatins the from-scratch autoencoder neural network for texture analysis. To run the code, just run the code in google colab.
From accuracy metrics to forward and backward propagations are coded without any use of machine learning libraries.
The example output can be seen in the .pdf file.
